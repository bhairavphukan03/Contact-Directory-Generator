# Contact-Directory-Generator
Our task is to implement a smartphone directory that collects contact data from the user until the user prompts the program to. Contact data refers to the contactâ€™s name, phone number, date-of-birth, a category that contact belongs to (Friends, Family, Work, Other), e-mail address. The user may enter as much data as he can in the mentioned data labels. If some labels remain void of data, store it as None. A name &amp; the number is mandatory to create contact. Implement the following operations on the directory: Insert, Delete, Search, Display.
